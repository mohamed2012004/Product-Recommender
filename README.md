# Recommender Chatbot

This chatbot is built on a commerce dataset to provide personalized product recommendations. It leverages advanced techniques and is deployed on a scalable cloud environment.

---

## Application Overview

The Recommender Chatbot offers intelligent product suggestions by combining advanced retrieval and generation techniques with robust deployment and monitoring tools. The system architecture comprises two main stages:

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Late Chunking

* Implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using the late chunking technique for efficient and relevant information retrieval.
* Based on the methodology described in the [referenced paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04701), which enhances recommendation relevance and coherence by breaking down data into manageable chunks during retrieval.

### 2. Model Deployment and Monitoring

* Deployed as a Flask web application exposing the chatbot API.
* Real-time monitoring integrated with Prometheus.
* Visualization and alerting set up through Grafana dashboards.
* Managed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Kubernetes or other orchestration tools via YAML configuration files for scalability and reliability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Docker (optional, for containerization)
* Kubernetes cluster or local Kubernetes setup (e.g., Minikube) for deployment
* Google Cloud Platform account (for production deployment)
* Prometheus and Grafana installed/configured for monitoring

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Product-Recommender.git
cd Product-Recommender
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables in `.env` file.

5. Run the Flask application locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

---

## Deployment

* Use the provided `Dockerfile` to build the container image.
* Deploy the Flask app with `flask-deployment.yaml` on your Kubernetes cluster.
* Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using their respective YAML files under `prometheus/` and `grafana/`.
* Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Flask app.
* Access Grafana dashboards for monitoring and alerting.

---

## Monitoring

* Prometheus collects real-time metrics about the chatbot service.
* Grafana visualizes metrics and provides alerting capabilities to monitor performance and uptime.
